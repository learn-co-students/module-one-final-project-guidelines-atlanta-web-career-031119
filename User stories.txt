** Things I've learned while working on this project **

1)  The Craftsmen's Curse - The ability to always see that there is room for improvement regardless of the state your app is in.

2)  Working in a team can be incredibly hard due to different programming styles, having to conform to one style can be difficult.

3)  Databases are actually not that bad if you have the right tools to manage it, and... a lot of luck to not break everything and lose important data.
